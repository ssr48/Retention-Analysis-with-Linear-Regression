# First Term GPA and Retention Analysis with Linear Regressions

This repository contains the code and the results of a linear regression analysis aimed at understanding the statistically significant factors in determining the first term GPA of freshmen undergraduate students. The analysis uses data for freshmen students enrolled in Fall semesters for the academic years 2013-14 through 2018-19. The data and some of the identifiable output files are hidden. 

In addition to the first-term GPA analysis, the code also cleans the data for a descriptive Tableau dashboard for retention analysis.

Below is a brief description of all the codefiles

## 2013 to 2017, 2018, and 2019
2013 to 2017, 2018, and 2019 clean the data for first term GPA of students enrolled from 2013 through 2019

## Append
